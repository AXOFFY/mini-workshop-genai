Trump ‘big beautiful’ bill gives top 1% biggest tax cuts in these states,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-gives-top-1percent-biggest-tax-cuts-in-these-states-.html,"Amassive package of tax cutschampioned by President Trump andawaiting a final votein the Housewould be a windfallfor the wealthiest U.S. households. But the size of that financial benefit depends largely on wherehigh-income taxpayerslive, according to a newanalysisby the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
The legislation would give the top 1% of U.S. households an average tax cut of about $66,000, or about 2.4% of their income, in 2026, according to ITEP, a left-leaning think tank. (These households have incomes of $917,000 or more per year, averaging about $2.7 million, it said.)
Some households stand to get a much bigger tax benefit.
The wealthiest households in three states — Wyoming, South Dakota and Texas — would see their annual tax bills fall by more than $100,000, ITEP found.
In Wyoming, the top 1% would see their taxes fall most: by an average of about $133,000 (or 3% of income) in 2026, it said. The average income of the top 1% in the state is about $4.5 million.
""The bill is most advantageous to conservative-leaning states that have a lot of very wealthy people living within their borders,"" said Carl Davis, ITEP's research director.
These states also don't levy personal income taxes, he said.
Wyoming and Texas ""are classic examples of states with a lot of wealthy people and which tax those wealthy people incredibly lightly,"" Davis said.
Senate Republicanspassed the legislation, originally called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, on Tuesday with the slimmest of margins. House Republicans are poised to pass the bill Thursday and send it to the president for his signature.
The legislation offers more than $4 trillion of net tax cuts over a decade, with most benefits accruing to higher-income households, analyses have found. It also slashes the social safety net, cutting billions of dollars from programs like Medicaid and food stamps meant to help lower earners.

The centerpiece of the bill is an extension of 2017 tax cuts enacted during President Trump's first term in office.
Overall, the legislation lowers income tax rates, exempts a larger share of wealthy estates from taxation and offers tax breaks to business owners. These are among the core ways the GOP bill benefits high-income households, Davis said.
It also caps the amount of state and local income taxes and property taxes that households can deduct from their taxable income each year, at $40,000.
That ""SALT"" policydoesn't negatively impact wealthy residents in states like Wyoming, South Dakota and Texas, where residents don't owe state income tax, Davis said. But it has a large impact on states with high state and local income taxes and property taxes.
In other words, high-income residents of Wyoming, South Dakota and Texas generally get most of the tax upside and not much downside, he said.
Conversely, the highest earners in California and New Jersey would see a smaller tax cut in 2026, averaging about $34,000 and $21,000, respectively, ITEP found. That represents about 1% of their income in each state.
Separate analyses have found that the wealthiest households will reap the largest financial benefits from the GOP bill.
The top 20% of U.S. households (earning more than $217,000 a year)would get a tax cutequivalent to 3.4% of their after-tax income in 2026, according to the Tax Policy Center. Meanwhile, the bottom 20% would get a 0.8% tax cut.
Its analysis only examined the tax portions of the legislation.
Overall, more comprehensive analyses that also account for cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the lowest earnerswould be worse off, according to analyses by the Budget Lab at Yale University and the Congressional Budget Office, which modeled similar legislation passed by the House last month.",2025-07-03 18:17:58.622874

Sutskever's announcement on Thursday comes afterMetapoachedDaniel Gross, a longtime entrepreneur and AI investor who had been CEO of Safe Superintelligence.
In apost on X, Sutskever said Gross' time at the company has been ""winding down,"" and that his last day was June 29. Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Levy will now serve as president, and the company's technical team will continue to report to Sutskever, he said.
Meta CEOMark Zuckerberghas been on a multibillion-dollar AI hiring spree, highlighted by a $14 billion investment in Scale AI that brought the startup's founder Alexandr Wang and a small group of his lead engineers to Meta.
Zuckerberg announceda new organizationon Monday called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. However, Gross' name was not listed among the new hires mentioned by Zuckerberg.
Gross did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
During Zuckerberg's AI hiring blitz, Meta tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, but Sutskever rebuffed those efforts,CNBC previously reported. Safe Superintelligence wasreportedlyvalued at $32 billion in a fundraising round in April.
Sutskever confirmed his plans on Thursday to keep running the company as an independent organization.
""⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through,"" Sutskever wrote. ""We have the compute, we have the team, and we know what to do. Together we will keep building safe superintelligence.""
Sutskever previously served as OpenAI's chief scientist and co-led the company's Superalignment team with Jan Leike, who left to join rival AI firm Anthropic.

CoreWeave is the first cloud provider to deploy Nvidia's latest AI chips,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/coreweave-dell-blackwell-ultra-nvidia.html,"In this article
Nvidia'sBlackwell Ultra chips, the company's next-generation graphics processor forartificial intelligence, have been commercially deployed at CoreWeave, the companiesannouncedon Thursday.
CoreWeave has received shipments of Dell-built shipments based around Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 AI systems,Dellsaid on Thursday. It's the first cloud provider to install systems based aroundBlackwellUltra.
The Blackwell Ultra is Nvidia's latest chip, expected to ship in volume during the rest of the year. The systems that CoreWeave is installing are liquid-cooled and include 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Nvidia Grace CPUs. The systems are assembled and tested in the U.S., Dell said.
CoreWeave shares rose 6% during trading on Thursday, Dell shares were up about 2% and Nvidia rose less than 2%.
The announcement is a milestone for Nvidia.
AI developers still clamor for the latest Nvidia chips, which have improvements that make them better for training and deploying models.
Nvidia said Blackwell Ultra can produce 50 times more AI content than its predecessor, Blackwell.
Investors closely watch how Nvidia manages the transition when it announces new AI chips to see if there are production issues or delays. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in May that Blackwell Ultra shipments would start in the current quarter.
It's also a win forCoreWeave, a cloud provider that rents access to Nvidia GPUs to other clouds and AI developers. Although CoreWeave is smaller than the cloud services operated byAmazon,Google, andMicrosoft, its ability to offer Nvidia's latest chips first give it a way to differentiate itself.
CoreWeave historically has a close relationship with Nvidia, which owns a stake in thecloud provider.CoreWeave went public earlier this year, and the stock price has quadrupled since its IPO.",2025-07-03 18:18:02.014958

Top five tax changes for the wealthy in Trump's 'big beautiful bill',https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-big-beautiful-bill-top-five-tax-changes-for-the-wealthy.html,"The wealthy will likely see a host of new tax breaks in President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" along with permanent extensions of many of the 2017 tax cuts, according to tax experts.
Taxpayers earning $1 million or more are expected tosee a boostin after-tax income of about 3% in the Senate version of Trump’s bill, according to the Tax Policy Center. That compares with thenationwide averageof about 2.5%. In dollar terms, millionaire earners will see an average after-tax income increase of $75,000 in 2026,according to the Tax Policy Center.
Virtually all the core provisions of the 2017 tax cut are expected to be extended in the final bill, which is expected to be approved by the House on Thursday, with some provisions becoming permanent. There are also several new tax breaks or benefits added in the bill that further lower tax bills for those at the top — especially for investors in small businesses.
Here are the five most important changes in the bill that affect high earners and the wealthy.
Surprisingly, the Senate bill largely follows the House's version of the state and local tax, or SALT, cap increase. The existing $10,000 cap on SALT deductions willrise to $40,000for those making less than $500,000, with the income threshold rising 1% a year. Initially the Senate was opposed to a change that largely benefits blue-state top earners. Yet after threats from the House, the Senate agreed to the $40,000 level.
Unlike the original House version of SALT, however, the Senate bill preserves a popular loophole to get around the cap. Dozens of states allow a workaround, called thepass-through entity tax, or PTET,that encourages pass-through owners and partners to avoid the cap at the state level. It benefits everyone from car dealers and dentists to accounting and law partners, but not employees of those firms.

The initial House version of the bill eliminated the loophole benefit for service industries and most white-collar firms, such as accountants, lawyers and doctors, according to Kyle Pomerleau at the American Enterprise Institute. Yet the Senate didn’t follow the House change.
“The Senate version has no limitation on the workarounds,” Pomerleau said, “effectively allowing these taxpayers to utilize an unlimited SALT deduction.”
Entrepreneurs and investors in small businesses will cheer a change in qualified small business stock, or QSBS. Created during the Clinton administration and expanded under President Barack Obama, the program is designed to encourage investments and creation of small companies. Under current law, investors or owners of a qualifying C Corp for more than five years get reductions in capital gains taxes when they sell. A qualifying company is defined as a “small business” if its total assets are $50 million or less. When a business is sold, owners or investors are exempt from capital gains taxes up to $10 million, or 10 times the original basis of the investment, whichever is greater.
The Senate bill raises the threshold to qualify as a “small business” from $50 million to $75 million. It also increases the exclusion from $10 million to $15 million, and it creates a new, tiered system for allowing tax breaks for those who want to sell before five years.
Justin Miller, partner and national director of wealth planning at Evercore, said the new rules would allow an investor to put $74.9 million into a small business and have up to $749 million exempt from capital gains if it sold for more than 10 times the original basis.
“It’s encouraging wealthy investors in qualified small businesses with enormous potential,” Miller said.
Like the version the House put forward, the Senate bill makes the estate tax permanent, which in Washington means it won’t have a built-in expiration date. The exemption would increase to $15 million per estate or $30 million for couples, and the exemption will be indexed for inflation.
For the ultra-wealthy, the estate tax is the most important of all the major tax code provisions. So having some stability, at least until the next election, will make for calmer estate planning and gifts.
The Senate bill includes a limit on the value of itemized deductions that was also included in the original House bill. Only about 10% of Americans — mostly the wealthy — still itemize their taxes, since the standard deduction is now $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Under both the House and Senate versions, taxpayers in the top bracket will have to subtract 2/37th from the value of each dollar deducted over the threshold. The net effect is that top taxpayers will only get a deduction benefit of 35 cents for every dollar, rather than 37 cents.
There’s good news and bad news for charitable giving, depending on your income level. For lower- and middle-income earners, the Senate bill includes a provision to encourage more charitable giving by the 90% of Americans who no longer itemize. The 2017 tax cuts doubled the standard deduction, eliminating the incentive for the vast majority of taxpayers to itemize and claim the charitable deduction. The Senate bill allows taxpayers to take the standard deduction and still claim a charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married joint filers.
Yet for wealthy donors, who now account for the majority of charitable giving, the Senate bill is decidedly uncharitable. It decreases the value of the charitable deduction for high-income taxpayers by capping itemized deductions and sets a new floor of 0.5% of adjusted gross income for the itemized charitable deduction.
So someone with $1 million in adjusted gross income wouldn’t get a tax break on the first $5,000 of donations.",2025-07-03 18:18:03.150853
"IPO market gets boost from Circle's 500% surge, sparking optimism that drought is over",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/ipo-market-boost-from-circle-500percent-surge-vcs-say-drought-may-be-ending.html,"For over three years, venture capital firms have been waiting for this moment.
Tech IPOs came to avirtual standstillin early 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates, while big acquisitions were mostly off the table as increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe turned away potential buyers.
Though it's too soon to say those days are entirely in the past, the first half of 2025 showed signs of momentum, with June in particular producing much-needed returns for Silicon Valley's startup financiers. In all, there were five tech IPOs last month, accelerating from a monthly average of two since January, according to data from CB Insights.
Highlighting that group was crypto companyCircle, which more than doubled in its New York Stock Exchangedebuton June 5, and is now up sixfold from its IPO price for a market cap of $42 billion. The stock got abig boostin mid-June after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, which would establish a federal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins.
Venture firms General Catalyst, Breyer Capital and Accel now own a combined $8 billion worth of Circle stock even after selling a fraction of their holdings in the offering. Silicon Valley stalwarts Greylock, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital are set to soon profit from Figma's IPO, after the design software vendor filed itspublic prospectuson Tuesday. Since its $20 billion acquisition agreement withAdobewasscrappedin late 2023, Figma has been one of the most hotly anticipated IPOs in startup land.
It's ""refreshing and something that we've been waiting for for a long time,"" said Eric Hippeau, managing partner at early-stage venture firm Lerer Hippeau, regarding the exit environment. ""I'm not sure that we are confident that this can be a sustained trend yet, but it's been very encouraging.""
Another positive sign for the industry the past couple months was the performance of artificial infrastructure providerCoreWeave, whichwent publicin late March. The stock was relatively stagnant for its first month on the market but shot up 170% in May and another 47% in June.
For venture firms, long considered the lifeblood of risky tech startups, IPOs are essential in order to generate profits for the university endowments, foundations and pension funds that allocate a portion of their capital to the asset class. Without handsome returns, there's little incentive for limited partners to put money into future funds.
After a record year in 2021, which saw 155 U.S. venture-backed IPOs raise $60.4 billion, according todatafrom University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, every year since has been relatively dismal. There were 13 such offerings in 2022, followed by 18 in 2023 and 30 last year, collectively raising $13.3 billion, Ritter's data shows.
The slowdown followed the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking campaign in 2022, meant to slow crippling inflation. As the lower-growth environment extended into years two and three, venture firms faced increasing pressure to return cash to investors.
In its2024 yearbook, the National Venture Capital Association said that even with a 34% increase in U.S. VC exit value last year to $98 billion, that number is 87% below the 2021 peak and less than half the average for the four years from 2017 through 2020. It's a troubling dynamic for the 58,000 venture-backed companies that have raised a total of $947 billion from investors, according to the annual report, which is produced by the NVCA and PitchBook.
""This backlog of liquidity drought risks creating a 'zombie company' cohort — businesses generating operational cash flow but lacking credible exit prospects,"" the report said.
Other than Circle, the latest crop of IPOs mostly consists of smaller and lesser-known brands. Health-tech companiesHinge HealthandOmada Healthare valued at about $3.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively.Etoro, an online trading platform, has a market cap of just over $5 billion. Online banking providerChime Financialhas a higher profile due largely to a years-long marketing blitz and is valued at close to $11.5 billion.
Meanwhile, the highest valued private companies like SpaceX, Stripe and Databricks remain on the sidelines, and AI highfliers OpenAI and Anthropic continue to raise massive amounts of cash with no intention of going public anytime soon.
Still, venture capitalists told CNBC that there are plenty of companies with the financial metrics to be public, and that more of them are readying for the process.
""The IPO market is starting to open and the VC world is cautiously optimistic,"" said Rick Heitzmann, a partner at venture firm FirstMark in New York. ""We are preparing companies for the next wave of public offerings.""
There are other ways to make money in the meantime. Secondary sales, a process that involves selling private shares to new investors, are on the rise, allowing early employees and investors to get some liquidity.
And then there's whatMark Zuckerbergis doing, as he tries to position his company at the center of AI innovation and development.
Last month,Metaannounceda $14 billion bet on Scale AI, taking a 49% stake in the AI startup in exchange for poaching founder Alexandr Wang and a small group of his top engineers. The deal effectively bought out half of the stock owned by investors, leaving them with the opportunity to make money on the rest of their holdings, should a future acquisition or IPO take place.
The deal is a big win for Accel, which led Scale AI's Series A round in 2017, and is poised to earn more than $2.5 billion in the transaction. Index Ventures led theSeries Bin 2018, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund led the Series C the following year at avaluation of over $1 billion.
Investors now hope the Federal Reserve will move toward a rate-cutting campaign, though the central bank hasn't committed to one. There's also ongoing optimism that regulators will make going public less burdensome. Last week,Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that U.S. stock exchanges and the SEC have discussed loosening regulations to make IPOs more enticing.
Mike Bellin, who headsconsulting firm PwC'sU.S. IPO practice, said he anticipates a diversity of IPOs across sectors in the second half of the year. According to data from PwC, pharma and fintech were among the most active sectors for deals through the end of May.
While the recent trend in IPO activity is an encouraging sign for investors, potential roadblocks remain.
Tariffs and geopolitical uncertaintydelayedIPO plans from companies including Klarna and StubHub in April. Neither has provided an update on when they plan to debut.
FirstMark's Heitzmann said the path forward is ""not at all clear,"" adding that he wants to see a strong quarter of economic stability and growth before confidently saying that the market is wide open.
Additionally, other than CoreWeave and Circle, recent tech IPOs haven't had big pops. Hinge Health, Chime and eToro have seen relatively modest gains from their offer price, while Omada Health is down.
But virtually any activity beats what VCs were experiencing the last few years. Overall, Hippeau said recent IPO trends are generally encouraging.
""There's starting to be kind of light at the end of the tunnel,"" Hippeau said.

Essence Fest leads a summer of events for Black entrepreneurs amid economic woes,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/essence-fest-leads-a-summer-of-events-for-black-entrepreneurs.html,"In a year when the U.S. consumer has been weighed down by economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and inflation, Black entrepreneurs are eager to get to the Essence Festival of Culture to connect with their core customers.
""Essence Fest is like my Black Friday,"" said Rochelle Ivory, owner of beauty brand On the Edge Baby Hair. ""It is my biggest sales weekend of the year. It's where I make all the capital I reinvest in my business.""
Essence Fest kicks off on Friday, with roughly 500,000 people attending the event in New Orleans. It generates around $1 billion in economic activity, according to organizers.
""It's the cannot-miss event for us,"" said Brittney Adams, owner of eyewear brand Focus and Frame. She said this year Essence Fest is even more important because she's seen Black consumers pulling back on spending.
""I would say the uncertainty of just the economic and political climate — that's giving people a little bit of hesitancy. Should they save the money? Should they buy the things they want?"" Adams said.
Ivory said her sales are down roughly 30% year over year, but she's hopeful people come to New Orleans looking to spend their time and money in the festival marketplace.
""This could make or break some of us,"" she said. ""It's one of the few places where Black women, Black founders can really come together and be seen.""
The Global Black Economic Forum aims to bring visibility and create solutions for Black business owners at Essence Fest. This year speakers include Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Last year, then-Vice President Kamala Harris spoke.
""We intentionally curate a space that allows leaders to preserve, build and reimagine how we can collectively increase economic opportunity to thrive,"" said Alphonso David, CEO of the GBEF.
While many Black Americans express economic anxiety, the data is less clear.
In the first quarter of this year, according toFederal Reserve data,the median weekly salary for Black workers was $1,192 a 5% increase year over year. Black unemployment stood at 6% in the most recent jobs report, a historically low number, but still higher than the national average of 4.2%.
However, the data doesn't appear to fully reflect the sentiment for many Black Americans who are concerned about the political, cultural and economic shifts that have taken place since President Donald Trump's election.
""Never let a good crisis go to waste,"" said John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation Hope, one of the nation's largest non-profits focused on financial education and empowerment.
Bryant said he sees the concerns of Black Americans as an opportunity in the second half of 2025.
""This president has done something that hasn't been done since the 1960s, which is unify Black America. Wealth was created in the early 20thcentury because Blacks were forced to work together. But instead of Black Lives Matter, let's make Black capitalist matter,"" he said.
Pastor Jamal Bryant of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church has galvanized Black consumers with an organized boycott ofTargetthat began in February in response to the retailer's decision toroll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Bryant said he is in discussions with Target but is ready to organize a longer-term boycott if the retailer does not fulfill thepromises it made to the Black communityafter the killing of George Floyd. He is urging Black Americans to use the estimated $2.1 trillion dollars in spending power forecast by 2026 todrive economic and political change.
""I would dare say that 'pocketbook protests' are a revolutionary activity,"" said Bryant.
""I think we have to be very selective in light of the 'Big Ugly Bill' that just passed and how it will adversely affect our community,"" he said, referencing Trump's megabill that passed through Congress this week.
Invest Fest, an event that blends commerce and culture created by financially focused media companyEarn Your Leisurekicks off in Atlanta in August.
Co-CEOs Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings said the event will remain focused on financial literacy, but this year they are emphasizing the urgent need for education and entrepreneurship in technology.
""It's definitely now or never, the time is now,"" said Bilal.
""The important thing this year is the way technology is going to disrupt a lot of career paths and the businesses, and we have to prepare for that, which is why AI is at the forefront of the conversation, crypto is at the forefront of the conversations, real estate as always and entrepreneurship,"" said Millings.
New this year is a partnership with venture capital firmOpen Opportunityand apitch competitionwhere an entrepreneur can win $125,000 in funding to scale their business.
""We need more businesses that can reach $100 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, get on the stock market. The pathway to that 9 times out of 10 is technology,"" Bilal said.
The National Black MBA Association Conference in Houston in September will have a similar tone. The event is known for its career fair where the nation's largest companies recruit as well as for networking and vibrant social activities.
This year, interim CEO Orlando Ashford is working to establish artificial intelligence education and financial literacy as pillars of the event.
""Doing business as usual is not an option,"" Ashford told CNBC. ""AI is something I literally refer to as a tsunami of change that's on its way. All of us will be forced to pivot in some ways as it relates to AI. Those of us that are out in front, that embrace it and leverage it actually can turn it into a tremendous and powerful opportunity. Those that wait and ignore it will be overtaken by the wave.""",2025-07-03 18:18:06.944001

"Retail avoided worst case in Vietnam, but Trump trade deal could still hurt",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/retailers-respond-to-trump-vietnam-trade-deal.html,"The retail industry is breathing a sigh of relief after it appeared to avoidthe worst case scenarioon Vietnam tariffs.
But some executives believethe tentative trade dealPresidentDonald Trumpannounced Wednesday is still bad for business and could have a chilling effect on consumer spending.
""It's a lot better news than where we were on Liberation Day,"" one CEO of a popular consumer brand told CNBC afterTrump saidtariffs on Vietnamese imports would be 20%, down from the 46% levy he proposed on April 2, then later suspended. The new rate would be double the 10% duty currently in place.
Another executive called the news ""bad"" but agreed that a 20% tariff was better than the 46% duty Trump originally imposed, however unrealistic the proposed rate was.
""I guess Trump needs 'positive' news,"" a third executive said. ""I think things are going to evolve. Let's see if this is definitive.""
Trump's announcement on Wednesday came only days before the 90-day suspension of the steep tariffs he proposed in April expires next week, and as his administration scrambles to strike agreements with dozens of trading partners. Even so, he did not say when the deal with Vietnam would take effect, or whether both sides have agreed to the tariff rates.
In the months between Trump's April 2 tariff rollout and his announcement on Wednesday, retail executives in the apparel and footwear industries fretted over the potential that Vietnam imports could face tariffs nearly as high as the cumulative 55% duties for Chinese imports.
Over the last decade, some of America's top retailers, includingGap,American EagleandNike, have all reduced their reliance on China to shield themselves from both high tariffs and the region's geopolitical turbulence.
Manysought refuge in Vietnam, where the factories, some owned by Chinese businesses, are known to produce products at a similar quality and price as China. They also started manufacturing in other countries in southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Those countries were facing tariffs of 49%, 37% and 24%, respectively, under Trump's April plan, but are subject to a 10% duty for now.
Vietnam is now the second largest supplier for footwear, apparel and accessories sold into the U.S. market, according to the industry trade group the American Apparel & Footwear Association. It has become an essential part of the footwear supply chain, on pace to become the largest supplier of shoes to the U.S. in 2025, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, another industry trade group.
If Trump's proposed 46% tariff on Vietnam had taken effect, it would mean much of the industry's work to leave China would have been for naught. Some companies are relieved the tentative deal would set the levy at 20% and the announcement agreement is also a sign that Cambodia, Malaysia and Bangladeshcould reach similar frameworks.
""Twenty percent is a sigh of relief,"" said Sonia Lapinsky, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners who advises fashion brands. ""There's some positivity and some optimism that this is manageable. So at least there's that. This isn't business destroying, which is great. However, this does have real implications, right?""
Most companies have plenty of tools to offset the impact of tariffs, such as working with their suppliers to share costs. But to avoid major hits to their profit margins, manyincluding Nikeare planning to raise prices. It's still unclear how those hikes will affect consumer spending because it will take time for the increases to trickle down in the supply chain.
AlixPartners previously createdpricing modelsfor CNBC that examined how the price of Vietnamese-made sweaters and shoes could rise under Trump's proposed tariffs — if retailers do not pass any of the cost on to suppliers or shoppers. At a 10% levy, the cost of a $95 pair of men's shoes could rise by $7.42 to $102.42. With a 20% duty in place, the cost increase would be even larger.
Many executives worry any tariff hike of this magnitude will be bad for businesses and consumers. Paul Cosaro, the CEO of Picnic Time, a supplier to top retailers likeTarget,Kohl'sandMacy's, said if the clocks were wound back to April and Trump said there'd be a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, ""no one would've been happy.""
""There could be threats of a 46% tariff and you come back with 20 and it's going to sound better but… it's just more money coming out of the consumers' pockets at the end of the day and they have less money to spend on picnic baskets and coolers and things like that,"" said Cosaro, who raised his prices between 11% and 14% earlier this year to offset the cost of China tariffs.
""It's not good for the consumer. Ultimately, it's just increasing the prices … I don't think that's good news.""",2025-07-03 18:18:08.609684

Here's where the jobs are for June 2025 — government sector leads the way,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/heres-where-the-jobs-are-for-june-2025.html,"State and local government job growth powered the U.S. labor market's expansion in June.
Government jobs saw the largest month-over-month sector growth at 73,000, according to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday. That means government jobs accounted for about half of the147,000 totalnonfarm payroll growth in June.
""Government at the state and local levels did much of the hiring in June,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. That helped ""the total payrolls number to top expectations,"" he said.
State government payrolls grew by 47,000, while local governments added 33,000 jobs. The bulk of those new jobs on both levels were in education, the data shows.
On the other hand, the federal government payroll shrank by 7,000 jobs in the month. That's unsurprising given the continuedfocus on government job-cutting initiativesunder President Donald Trump.
Bankrate's Hamrick warned that it would be hard for state and local governments to sustain such strong growth.
Health care and social assistance saw the next biggest monthly growth, adding more than 58,000 positions. Paired with government, the two sectors accounted for nearly 9 out of 10 new jobs on balance in June.
Leisure and hospitality and construction were also among industries seeing payrolls expand significantly in the month, according to the BLS data.
But labor force growth was capped by constriction in several sectors. Professional and business services, manufacturing and wholesale trade each lost around 7,000 net jobs in June.",2025-07-03 18:18:11.132941

Trump speaks with Putin after U.S. pauses some weapons shipments to Ukraine,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html,"PresidentDonald Trumpspoke to Russian PresidentVladimir Putinon Thursday for nearly an hour, according to a Kremlin official translated by NBC News.
Part of the conversation was about Ukraine, the official said. Two days earlier, the U.S. said it would halt some missile and ammunitionsshipments to thecountry, which continues to fight off invading Russian forces.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the pause weeks after ordering a review of America's munitions stockpile, sources told NBC News.
Trump ""raised the issue of an immediate ceasefire"" between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian official said on a call with reporters.
Putin said he was focused instead on a ""political resolution to the conflict through negotiations.""
The Russian president also said his country ""will pursue its stated objectives"" in Ukraine, according to the official.
""Namely, to eliminate the well-known root causes that led to the current situation and the sharp confrontation. Russia will not abandon those goals,"" the official said.
The U.S. decision this week to pause the Ukraine shipments fueled concerns from those skeptical of Trump's commitment to providing U.S. assistance to Ukraine in the fourth year of its war with Russia.
""Ukraine has never asked America to send in the 82nd airborne; they've asked for the weapons to defend their homeland and people from Russia attacks,"" said Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of State during Trump's first presidential term, in an X post Wednesday.
""Letting Russia win this war would be a unmitigated disaster for the American people and our security around the world,"" Pompeo wrote.
On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the department ""continues to provide the President with robust options regard regarding military aid to Ukraine, consistent with his goal of bringing this tragic war to an end.""
At the same time, he said, the Pentagon is ""rigorously examining and adapting its approach towards achieving this objective while also preserving U.S. military readiness and defense priorities that support the president's America first agenda,"" Parnell said.
""This capability review, and that's exactly what it is, going forward, we see this as a common sense pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,"" he said.
Ukraine PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid Wednesday that Washington and Kyiv are ""clarifying all the details of defense support, including air defense.""
""One way or another, we must ensure protection for our people,""Zelenskyy said.
The pause comes as Russia has ramped up its attacks all around Ukraine. Kyiv's foreign affairs minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia launched more than 5,000 combat drones and hundreds of missiles, including nearly 80 ballistic missiles, in June alone.
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stressed to a U.S. official on Wednesday that ""any delay or slowing down in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities would only encourage the aggressor to continue war and terror, rather than seek peace.""",2025-07-03 18:18:12.966701

"What young workers want from jobs, how they rate biggest companies: CNBC survey",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/what-americas-youngest-workers-want-from-jobs-cnbc-survey.html,"Young Americans will play a significant role in shaping workplaces in the decades ahead, and a new study conducted by Generation Lab for CNBC takes a look at how they feel about work-life balance and corporate culture.
One finding of note: younger employees are back at job sites, and they're okay with it.
Just over half (52%) of those polled say they're at work now ""every day.""
The majority of in-office numbers rise to a combined 86% when including those in four days a week (21% of respondents), and those in three days (15%).
For the majority of younger workers, the shift away from remote flexibility is not being made in resignation — they say being in the office three to four days a week seems fair to them.
Seventy-six percent of respondents said ""ideally"" they want to be at work at least three days a week.
The surveywas conducted from April 2-May 2 by Generation Lab via email, and includes close to 18,000 Americans between the ages of 18 to 34 who are either currently enrolled in higher education (two-year, four-year and technical colleges) or graduated within the past four years. Generation Lab is a data intelligence firm specializing in the study of trends among young people.
Only 9% of those polled said the ability to work remotely was the second most important issue (after money) when deciding on where to work. Thirty-six percent cited ""career/skill development"" as their top priority after money, while 27% said ""company and team culture"" ranked second to compensation.
While they are happy to be back at the workplace, the loyalty of younger workers will have to be earned by employers. Only 7% say they are ""committed to staying at a company for the long haul,"" while just 16% say they want to invest long-term in a company's success. But given the right career advancement opportunities, they will stay, with 46% of respondents saying they ""want to grow within the company but may consider external opportunities.""
Younger generations are willing to work long hours to get ahead, but they have their limits. When asked about willingness to work ""outside the bounds of your standard responsibilities"" nearly one-third (32%) said it is ""the best way to distinguish"" themselves on the job. But over half (56%) said they'd do it, ""but grudgingly,"" and that they ""value work-life balance.""
While much has been made in recent years of the autonomy younger workers desire, they expect their managers to invest the time in helping them to advance in their careers. The majority (64%) say they want regular feedback from their supervisors:
Only 12% of poll respondents said they want to hear from their supervisors once or twice a year.
Young employees want the feedback in person (62% said they ""best receive feedback face-to-face""), double those who said email, text or Slack. And many want the feedback from more than one source — 39% say they want to hear from ""multiple people and perspectives.""
Generation Lab also polled respondents to see which major companies they ""associate with unethical behavior or negative impact.""
Several big tech companies fared poorly on this question, withTesla(68%),Meta(64%), andAmazon(61%) all being perceived negatively by over 60% of respondents.
Boeing, at 61%, was the only other major company to be viewed negatively by more than 60% of the survey audience.
The three big tech firms have worse reputations among young Americans thanExxon Mobil(51% view the oil and gas company negatively).
Some of the hottest tech companies in the newest generation of Silicon Valley also had relatively low reputational scores compared to many companies: OpenAI (43% view it negatively) and Palantir (49% view it negatively).
""A few years ago, Tesla, Meta, Boeing and Amazon all would have been on the most favored list,"" said Cyrus Beschloss, CEO of Generation Lab. ""This may show these companies' communication mechanisms have failed to stop a leak of perceived bad news.""
The case of Tesla may be the most unique. ""Tesla has a great story to tell about its product but perceptions of Elon Musk's involvement in politics have not been a positive for the brand,"" Beschloss said. ""But he can probably turn that around by focusing on the good of the mission, if Musk decides to do so.""
A major issue since the start of the second Trump administration has been the administration's targeting of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and a subsequent retreat among companies supporting recently stated DEI goals. That doesn't fly with most young workers, and the survey indicates they will not support corporate employers that retreat on the issue.
A majority (67%) say they ""strongly support"" companies continuing at least some DEI initiatives, while 15% said they either ""prefer to eliminate"" DEI or ""prefer to scale it back.""
But a majority of respondents (58%) also indicated that when it comes to ""discussing politics in the workplace,"" they prefer to avoid it.
Trump administration tariffs, and the threat of more tariffs, have many economists and investors worried about a slowdown in economic growth and the potential for increasing layoffs. Greater use of artificial intelligence by employers is alsoweighing on entry-level worker job opportunitiesand level of professional confidence. While thelatest national employment dataremains solid, these fears are reflected among younger workers.
Close to three-quarters (72%) of those surveyed said they are either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about a recession that could impact their job prospects.
""A lot of smart young people are followingwhat business leaders say... casting doubt on the strength of the economy, and that's had an impact,"" Beschloss said. ""This age group also grew up during the Covid economy and in some cases the Great Recession in 2007. They're legitimately nervous,"" he said.
""Right now, young people are seeing symptoms of a struggling economy in their everyday lives — through difficulties finding a job, higher prices, and constant conversation about tariffs. Fittingly, there's no surprise that these recent difficulties and uncertainty had led to a growing sense that a recession could be on the horizon,"" added Jira Smith, research director at Generation Lab.
When it comes to finding a job, most respondents use LinkedIn (63%), with Indeed.com ranked second (58%), followed by Handshake (37%).
As far as where younger workers look for career advice, they keep it close to home: 81% said they start with mom or dad.",2025-07-03 18:18:16.153388
